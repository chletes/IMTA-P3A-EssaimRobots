# Matlab

This simulation and control law were tested on Matlab R2021b (Windows 10).

## How to launch the simulation 

1. Open Matlab in `/system_control`
2. (a) Double-click on `data.mat` from the "Current folder" window to load all the required variables. 
2. (b) Write `load(data.mat)` in the "Command Window"
3. (c) Import `data.mat` file using the "Model Explorer" in _Simulink_
4. Double-click on `one_robot.slx` from the "Current folder" window to launch _Simulink_ and open the model. 
5. Click on "Run" and after simulation, double-click on scopes to view output.
